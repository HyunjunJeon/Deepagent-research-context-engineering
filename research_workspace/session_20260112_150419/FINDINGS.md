## AdaFuse: Adaptive Ensemble Decoding with Test-Time Scaling for LLMs

**저자:** Chengming Cui, Tianxin Wei, Ziyi Chen, Ruizhong Qiu, Zhichen Zeng 외 4명
**발행일:** 2026-01-09
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022v1

### 초록
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, w...

## Chaining the Evidence: Robust Reinforcement Learning for Deep Search Agents with Citation-Aware Rubric Rewards

**저자:** Jiajie Zhang, Xin Lv, Ling Feng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li
**발행일:** 2026-01-09
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06021v1

### 초록
Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constru...

## Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics

**저자:** David A. Meyer, Asif Shakeel
**발행일:** 2026-01-09
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1

### 초록
We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step.
  When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and c

## Manifold limit for the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks

**저자:** Johanna Tengler, Christoph Brune, José A. Iglesias
**발행일:** 2026-01-09
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06025v1

### 초록
We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of u...

## LookAroundNet: Extending Temporal Context with Transformers for Clinically Viable EEG Seizure Detection

**저자:** Þór Sverrisson, Steinn Guðmundsson
**발행일:** 2026-01-09
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06016v1

### 초록
Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in
